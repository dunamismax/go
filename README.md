A personal repository for learning and experimenting with the Go programming language.  
This repo contains various Go scripts, programs, and applications that I develop as I grow my skills in Go.

## Overview

Welcome to the **Go Playground** repository by [dunamismax](https://github.com/dunamismax).  
Here, I explore and experiment with different aspects of Go—from small utility scripts to more involved applications.  
This repository is a work in progress, and I'm continuously updating it with new examples, experiments, and learning exercises  [oai_citation_attribution:3‡meakaakka.medium.com](https://meakaakka.medium.com/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3).

Repository Structure

The repository is organized to help keep different types of projects separate:
 • /scripts – Small Go scripts and learning exercises.
 • /programs – Larger applications and command-line tools.
 • /examples – Sample code that demonstrates specific Go features or best practices.

Feel free to explore and suggest improvements to this structure.

Usage

To run a Go script, navigate to the corresponding directory and use:

For building a compiled executable, run:

go build -o myprogram filename.go

Then execute the built program:

./myprogram
